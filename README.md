# 🏦 Customer Scoring 1.0 – Credit Approval Prediction with Machine Learning

[🔗 **Click HERE to explore the full project**](https://github.com/AleXcapo7/CUSTOMER_SCORING1.0)

## 💡 Introduction
Have you ever wondered how banks decide whether to approve or reject a loan?

**CUSTOMERSCORING1.0** is a complete machine learning project that simulates a real-world credit approval process using real customer data. The goal is to **predict loan approval** based on various personal and financial factors.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about individuals applying for loans, including:
- Age
- Gender
- Education
- Employment experience
- Income
- Credit score
- Previous defaults
- Home ownership
- Loan amount and intent
- Loan interest rate
- Loan percent of income
- Credit history length
- Loan status (target: 0 = rejected, 1 = approved)

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Perform complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Build and evaluate **supervised learning models**:
  - ✅ Logistic Regression
  - ✅ Decision Tree
  - ✅ Random Forest
  - 🔜 Neural Networks
- Apply **feature engineering, encoding, scaling, and class balancing**
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Feature Importance

## 🧠 Project Highlight: Customer Scoring 1.0
Developed a predictive model for loan approval using multiple supervised learning techniques:
- *Logistic Regression (for inference and prediction)*
- *Decision Tree (pruned model)*
- *Random Forest*
- *Neural Network (MLP with hidden layers)*  
Key tasks: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Encoding, Standardization, VIF, SMOTE, Model Evaluation (ROC, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC)
